font-mu-calculator
==================

This is a very simple utility for calculating a constant **mu** for a given
font. This is used to calculate ideal paragraph widths given a desired
characters-per-line value, as explained in [this
article](http://www.pearsonified.com/2012/01/characters-per-line.php) by Chris
Pearson.
